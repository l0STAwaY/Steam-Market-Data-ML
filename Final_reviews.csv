This is because of the stupid war support mechanic. Also, while I'm fighting, I learn that one of my cities is under siege by a random army of independent people. I have outposts on all the territories around my city and its on the coast. There is no unoccupied territories on the whole continent. Yet somehow a random army of independent people spawn in with the strongest units available and there is nothing I can do to stop them. Just randomly spawned out of nowhere, awesome.

I refused (obviously, I won and still had troops available) and they declared war on me (what?, I just crushed him). When they war started I had more war support than him (4 to 2) and I lost the following turn and had to relinquish territories that he didn't demand despite no battles or anything happening.

I can't even finish the daily missions because they require you to sortie multiple times. I really enjoyed this game on console because the multiplayer actually worked and the game play is an A+ experience, in my opinion. Even on console, the multiplayer connectivity was pretty bad and for the life of me, I can not understand why they have yet to fix it. If we could play cross-platform, that would IMMENSELY help the player count to grow.

The biggest fumble this game contains is one of the poorest matchmaking I've ever suffered through but is not what I'm discussing in particular. What I'm presenting is that the players who host custom matches are some of the most shallow and empty minded individuals that have ever graced this earth. To those who don't know, customs work where you host a match, edit the MS roster that people choose from, and then anyone can join and play. Sounds simple and should remedy bad matchmaking, right? Wrong! About 90% of the custom lobbies (among about 5-6 lobbies on a good day during peak hours) listed will be whats known as a ""A WIN Rotate"" game where MS costs are unrestricted, its a 1 round elimination match, and both teams are socially expected to take turns not playing the round (Whole Match) to allow the other team a guaranteed win (for the purpose of grinding the monthly missions, currency, and leveling up Mobile Suits) while match 'rotations' are normally a 5-6 minute process, meaning you have to wait every 10 minutes before its your turn to play. You might be thinking you can just AFK it and do something else while getting free progression right? Wrong! The game has this wonderful feature where you have to confirm you're MS after teams are formed but before the match actually starts, and if you don' confirm you'll get booted by the game, not the host, and have to wait until that last player slot is filled (I forgot to mention that all games, both official and custom can't actually be started unless you have a max lobby, normally 10-12 players). and after the match is said and done with, you have to manually confirm, again, the exp you gained and the rewards you may or may not have acquired (not guaranteed even with a win). My biggest quarrel with these lobbies is that they take players out of the pool, waste their time without them knowing or even caring because of 'EZ LOOT', and now you and everyone else who wants to play the game the way it was intended via custom or official matches have to wait for sometimes hours at a time just to get an actual shooter experience. In conclusion, customs could have been the cure for the worst matchmaking to exist and sometimes are, but the players in the community ruined that prospect.",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

Most of the people on the PC version are rank A. So to get decent matchmaking you have to be that rank. But there are not enough people playing to play enough games to get there in the first place. Custom games can help you find players faster to just hop into a casual game, but there are also a lot of cheaters, so chances are your fun will be ruined by people either instantly killing you, flying, shooting you from anywhere on the map or making everyone in the lobby invincible.",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

Notice how I used the word try? fun fact! you can't party up, period. You have to prey you are put in the same lobby as friends if you don't rely on custom matches. Now it may not be super difficult to find each other but this is because of how difficult it is to actually fill a match and it takes 10 to 30 minutes to get a match to start, and thats IF everyone readies up. Because if a single person isn't ready then get ready to wait for even longer. Now lets see... what else is there? oh ya! 700 cost is by far the worst to attempt especially with the recent addition of Nu Gundam that has a barrier that literally stays for 15 seconds and is 100% protection that can be abused and only mele-oh wait I think it even blocks melee! but thats the only gripe on that front. meanwhile the most problematic here is the way it handles disconnects. it might seem nice on first infraction and when back on good terms. . . wait did I say good terms? you actually aren't. first week I got disconnected as I lagged out and got put into caution, then was on good for an entire week only for my internet to drop entirely (was lucky not to be on during the 3 other drops) sends me to Penalty lv1 which is a 30 hour ban from both rated and quickplay and are unable to create a custom match! oh by the way you also need to pull yourself out of that penalty after being unable to tend to it because of the 30 hour ban. also after looking it up I discovered that if you go to pen lv2 then you are banned for a straight 5 days. Also during some questioning on reddit it used to actually be easier on people. now they are harsher and each disconnect in a match will give you a massive ding that makes good connection rep absolutely useless!!! Cool isn't it? so if you got bad internet then you are SOL. speaking of connection the game also rewards having lag. the server takes everything that happens on client side. this includes when people are stuck standing still on your screen are vulnerable to damage. because once your lag ends the damage slaps them all at once. oh same applies the other way around too. So in other words. you are both greatly punished AAAAAAAAAND rewarded for having a bad connection. If you got a connection that often fails then do yourself a favor and DON'T INSTALL. YOU WILL GET THE 5 DAY BAN. THERE IS NO APPEALING IT!",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

This game is fun, this game is frustrating, this game is literally the only modern Gundam game i enjoy playing. But if i play too long i get pissed. the gameplay revolves around stun mechanics. which would be fine, but its the only way to play this game. You have to equip weapons with good stun or you'll get nowhere in a match. The progression is a joke. you can only get really cool MS from a gacha game. good news though you can earn all the currency ingame... but than again, you can only get 3 per day by doing daily missions or doing maybe doing an AI mission. they suck. the level up system takes literally forever. im no where close to where i was on PS4 even after 40 hours.Finding a game most days is pointless. As of 5/14/2024 the game has less than 2000 players daily. Quickplay is unplayable because everyone goes into Ranked. Which is where all the try hards use all the Stun MS and weapons to win a game.For some reason even though the MS you can play are limited by a cost system, it being 100-700. they force you to play cost matches in rotations. so if you wanna play a 250 game but all there are are 400s and up, your outta luck. Why they did it like this i have no idea but its probably their biggest mistake sinse alot of the lower cost MS are really fun to play cause their so simple. like Basic GM and Zaku simple. i honestly just want a Gundam game that has a Singleplayer campaign, that lets you use a wide variety of gundams and MS. Or at the very least i want a modern take of Journey to Jaburo or Zeonic Front. This game can be fun but ultimatly i play it because i don't like the other Gundam games out right now and its the only descent one out right now that i kind enjoyed. But with no one playing it, and the game being less and less fun the more i revisit it. i dont think i'll be playing this anytime soon again.",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

I adore Gundam games and I really would like to see some work done to this port. In it's current state the game is unplayable due to server/matchmaking related issues. I get great performance on the steam version so I would love to see it put into a working condition but it's been two years of constant complaints and unfortunately it's turned up nothing.,Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

Bandai is cheap and will not pay for a server. This is all peer to peer. Latency is very high. The required and recommended specs are a lie. I am running a Ryzen 7 and 32g of DDR4 ram. The game runs well until the anticheat hits. The games uses Easy Anticheat. As of writing this the anti cheat is saving once a minute, which is up from previously once every 3 minutes. Each time it does my game slows down for 10 seconds. In a match this is instant death. In the lobby it means waiting to get through a menu. Such a shame because they can't stop the cheaters anyway. Friendly fire is on so your teammates often stun you, sometimes to get an advantage, and Bandai does nothing to stop them despite having a reporting system built into the game. You can report until you are blue in the face. Nothing will happen. Maybe all you have to do is whale to get immunity. This is a waste as the game play and system are excellent. Bandai should either get a server or focus on using this system in a single player game. Oh wait they have one, Code Fairy, but they won't release that on PC. I guess they have to stay in Sony's good graces and leave that as a PS exclusive.",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

Most the zakus are fine... but this game focuses on the worst most garbage mechanic in any live/realtime game. Staggering.

On day 1 most people couldn't even play the game since you would be stuck in a queue (without knowing). If you were able to get in on this day, you would have noticed that there were only about 21 planes to choose from in free flight, a big let down if you were like me and bought the premium deluxe version. On day 2, most people could get in, but they were greeted with a career mode that was filled with more bugs than my aunts basement. As an example; you could load into a mission and immediately get deducted points for exceeding the speed limit with flaps extended (while stationary). There is also absolutely no way to play online with your friends, which is one of, if not the biggest let down aside from the unplayable state of the career mode.
