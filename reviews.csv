I'd be hard pressed to say the game isn't good, but I'd be equally hard pressed to say it is fun when you really start to sink your teeth in. Instead, I'm confident it's just addictive. At the least?

I was in multiple wars with a neighbor, and in my latest war I captured their capital city. Very next turn, they forced me to surrender. Yep, I capture their city and they forced me to surrender. This is because of the stupid war support mechanic. Also, while I'm fighting, I learn that one of my cities is under siege by a random army of independent people. I have outposts on all the territories around my city and its on the coast. There is no unoccupied territories on the whole continent. Yet somehow a random army of independent people spawn in with the strongest units available and there is nothing I can do to stop them. Just randomly spawned out of nowhere, awesome.

The game is significantly unbalanced, you are at a great disadvantage if you unwilling to spend at least several hundred dollars in this game. The developer should be despised and ashamed for its greediness. Gambling/lottery like reward systems are also wide spread within the game.",Full_Release,not refunded,1180320,Project F

Its great in every aspect with its PS release. However, in reality, the PC release of this game fell VERY hard. This can mostly be pointed at the poor decisions and lack of care from the ones calling the shots at this studio. It goes to show that no matter how great a game is on paper, you can make it bad by just a couple choices.",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
