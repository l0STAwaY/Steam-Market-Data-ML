I always appreciate the ability to make essentially .jpegs of characters feel interesting to interact with just from the dialogue, and the twist to featuring already (sort of) familiar Greek mythological figures only added to the engagement. Actions felt like they had a purpose and impact in the story, and I could seek a challenge any time I felt like it, or the opposite really.

Overall, my absolute favourite part was the abundance of minigames. That was a delight. I am aware of its status as an indie game with a very small team behind it, and I can at least say it is very polished and well-executed for what it is. I don't regret playing MiSide, but it didn't deliver anything original or particularly thought-provoking despite going for a psychological horror angle, and was not especially scary, so I would not consider it worth full-price. There are lots of other indie horror games out there.",Full_Release,not refunded,2527500,MiSide

That will likely undermine the game's message even more by making it the very thing it's meant to criticize. If it doesn't, I'll be impressed, but with the way things are right now, I'm sure it will and I would rather the devs add replay value by actually entertaining the idea that the game would benefit from actual alternate paths of the main game.

No matter how much I shot at him, I couldn’t hit him. Just then, he reached the fire storage section and fired the anti-matter weapon. By that time, I realized that nothing mattered anymore, so I let him do as he pleased. James had reached my weapon and started firing bullets at me. However, for him, it was already too late. The bomb exploded on a massive scale, destroying all my efforts, all my colonists, and all my work in just a few seconds. That was it. The game was over, both for me and for James. But then, from the ruins, a voice emerged—it was one of the colonists, crawling and trying to heal themselves. Just then, James stumbled into the scene, stabbed my last remaining colonist with his spear, and slowly retreated from the map, leaving nothing but destruction behind.

The developers continue to update this game with great additions and modifications so the experience is more balanced and offers new exciting content. The new Chapter Specific gear (like the Dark Angels pack) and new weapons like the Neo Volkite Pistol, are great additions to this awesome game. I hope that they continue to add new various weapons and are able to include other playable Space Marines, eventually, such as the Librarians (Psyker Space Marines that manipulate the Warp), and Drednought Units (like the one featured in the game). I also hope that they are able to include other 40k elements like the Orks (like in the original Space Marine) , Necrons, Dark Eldar or even the Tau. The inclusion of more content from the 40k Universe, that Games Workshop allows them to access, means that the possibilities are almost endless. I'm looking forward to downloading and playing all of the content from the Warhammer 40k universe that they are able to include.

The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this.

Also when I won for the first time it was so underwhelming I didn't even realize the game was over.

I would personally recommend this game not just because it is fun, but because it has its own unique characteristics in comparison to other Battle Royale games like COD Warzone and Fortnite. You can certainly look up many things about this game, but I believe that it is most likely guaranteed you will find a legend in the roster that suits you best. There is also a great amount of customization in this game (Which can be very expensive if you choose to spend money on this game), comparable to the likes of the games I mentioned prior, with extra possessions like your tailored banner. The last thing I will say before I review this game critically is that it may be tough for new players, though if you research ways to get better online you will get through it. Now, since we have sung its praises with many more that I did not mention, we must now look at what apex does not get right or what it could fix to do better. Hacking is currently rampant in apex, especially in the competitive mode as you move up the ranks. This has been a problem for a very long time, possibly dating back to season 2 (when I started playing), when I was on console so at that time hacking was barely a concern or even not a concern at all, while when I switched to PC in season 3, I personally started seeing cheaters in game as soon as season 5. It also relates to the large incident that happened in ALGS recently, where 2 players (Genburten and ImperialHal) had their game hijacked, giving them esp with full hitboxes, health, and player names, along with bullet (not aim-locking) aimbot. Hacking is the only concern I will describe in this review because it has been recent, and is a genuine concern and has been for a long time. In conclusion, while apex has many great qualities I mentioned, there are some concerns that do not have to do with how the game is intended to be played. I would personally give the game an 8.9/10, because despite its shortcomings, it is unique, it can be tailored, and most of all, it is great, but its shortcomings hinder me from giving it a 9/10 (Amazing). Opinions can differ widely on how good or bad this game is depending on who you ask, so I am not expecting you to 100% believe in my opinion, and all I ask of you is that you at the very least consider it.",Full_Release,not refunded,1172470,Apex Legends

Apparently there aren't many people compared to the achievements that have passed. Bugged and poorly balanced. Too many weapons with little explanation unless you've played the campaign, running is an illusion, the skills are also pretty useless. Stupid skins, which are most of what you unlock, uninteresting and sometimes very small maps. The weapons have the feel of rubber bullets, very little violence or blood at all. The training levels teach almost nothing and there is an ugly IT that talks nonsense to you. The only thing that is a plus is that there are bots.

I was in multiple wars with a neighbor, and in my latest war I captured their capital city. Very next turn, they forced me to surrender. Yep, I capture their city and they forced me to surrender. This is because of the stupid war support mechanic. Also, while I'm fighting, I learn that one of my cities is under siege by a random army of independent people. I have outposts on all the territories around my city and its on the coast. There is no unoccupied territories on the whole continent. Yet somehow a random army of independent people spawn in with the strongest units available and there is nothing I can do to stop them. Just randomly spawned out of nowhere, awesome. How am I even supposed to deal with that? These two aspects just ruined this game for me and I doubt I'll pick this up again.",Full_Release,not refunded,1124300,HUMANKIND

There is a lot that is good about this game, but there are a lot of issues that should be easily fixed. There is no grace period after a war, I won a war and the next turn the AI demanded the same territory that we just fought over and I held. I refused (obviously, I won and still had troops available) and they declared war on me (what?, I just crushed him). When they war started I had more war support than him (4 to 2) and I lost the following turn and had to relinquish territories that he didn't demand despite no battles or anything happening. This is an issue apparently that has been around for a long time and the developer has no inclination to fix, this kind of issue that is a core mechanic (war and the aftermath) and continues to persist tells me that the developer has no real inclination to finish or fix the game, they got their money.",Full_Release,not refunded,1124300,HUMANKIND

Victory Points are forever, and the in this game they are achievement stars - you always know what you could be doing to get closer to winning. This is very well done, and a feature that ever player of the genre will admire. Combat is tactical, or automated.

However, going to next gen, i had my hopes that something has been done to the engine that will prevent cheating at least in the easiest form. Sadly, it wasn't. And this fact, coupled with the predatory MXT is still enough to never recommend this game to anyone. You WILL need to feed around 30-50 euros into the game minimally, if you want to actually have fun online. MXT that affect skills in a full priced game? I will NEVER EVER accept that.

I could never recommend this game to anyone who has never played early Maplestory, as it is just not friendly to new users, nor is it easy to catch up with people who are end game at this point.

The most recent event is the epitome of this behavior. While game development will always have its challenges, the game studio should have clear communication in regards to serious issues that affects 99% of the players who choose to participate in timed content (MapleStory relies hard on daily log in rewards and timed content). Changes are not reasonable to happen overnight or even within the same patch, but to leave the community in the dark without acknowledging, addressing, or simply expressing the steps they are taking behind the scenes is a slap in the face. If you look at the actions this company takes in similar situations, you will notice no communication until after players have lost out or invested time into content that they simply can not succeed in. At best they will post some statement about how sorry they are and offer some compensation that usually is so disconnected from what the players want or value equivalent to the frustration caused. I love this game and have for many years. It would mean a lot to us if you implemented long term changes to these business decisions and at the very least, stop restricting your community managers from actually managing the community.

Pixel art has always been a favorite of mine so I find the art style to be very endearing. You can have multiple characters and give each a unique style. Unfortunately though, the game is very heavy on using real currency to decorate said characters. As far as $3 USD per gacha, so only a CHANCE at the style you want. Even more frustrating is the amount of time they expect people to play the game. My current character at level 239 only gets 0.002% exp per monster she kills at her level... This is why they are struggling so hard to maintain a player base in the west. Popular games here let you directly buy the items you want or earn it in game.

Sometimes, the game does not even load. The frustration of the game's connectivity ruins the joy of an otherwise excellent game. Play the physical game or mobile game. If you can understand Chinese, download and play the game directly from the Chinese website. The game support on STEAM for this application is disappointing and weak to its core. It is no wonder it receives so many negative reviews on STEAM platform.",Full_Release,not refunded,1180320,War_of_the_Three_Kingdoms

They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin.

I can't even play the game, I ""fail matchmaking"" or search for a room for 25 to 40 minutes at a time and never find a match. I can't even finish the daily missions because they require you to sortie multiple times. I really enjoyed this game on console because the multiplayer actually worked and the game play is an A+ experience, in my opinion. Even on console, the multiplayer connectivity was pretty bad and for the life of me, I can not understand why they have yet to fix it. If we could play cross-platform, that would IMMENSELY help the player count to grow. I'm open to changing my review once this problem is fixed, but until then, I will try to join a match occasionally but I won't buy a single token until I can do it consistently.

The biggest fumble this game contains is one of the poorest matchmaking I've ever suffered through but is not what I'm discussing in particular. What I'm presenting is that the players who host custom matches are some of the most shallow and empty minded individuals that have ever graced this earth. To those who don't know, customs work where you host a match, edit the MS roster that people choose from, and then anyone can join and play. Sounds simple and should remedy bad matchmaking, right? Wrong! About 90% of the custom lobbies (among about 5-6 lobbies on a good day during peak hours) listed will be whats known as a ""A WIN Rotate"" game where MS costs are unrestricted, its a 1 round elimination match, and both teams are socially expected to take turns not playing the round (Whole Match) to allow the other team a guaranteed win (for the purpose of grinding the monthly missions, currency, and leveling up Mobile Suits) while match 'rotations' are normally a 5-6 minute process, meaning you have to wait every 10 minutes before its your turn to play. You might be thinking you can just AFK it and do something else while getting free progression right? Wrong! The game has this wonderful feature where you have to confirm you're MS after teams are formed but before the match actually starts, and if you don' confirm you'll get booted by the game, not the host, and have to wait until that last player slot is filled (I forgot to mention that all games, both official and custom can't actually be started unless you have a max lobby, normally 10-12 players). and after the match is said and done with, you have to manually confirm, again, the exp you gained and the rewards you may or may not have acquired (not guaranteed even with a win). My biggest quarrel with these lobbies is that they take players out of the pool, waste their time without them knowing or even caring because of 'EZ LOOT', and now you and everyone else who wants to play the game the way it was intended via custom or official matches have to wait for sometimes hours at a time just to get an actual shooter experience. In conclusion, customs could have been the cure for the worst matchmaking to exist and sometimes are, but the players in the community ruined that prospect.",Full_Release,not refunded,1367080,MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM BATTLE OPERATION 2

A reminder to anyone that read this far, Microsoft is a MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY with over 20,000 global employees just in the gaming sector of their company alone! The fact that they threw this heaping pile out to the world and expected good reviews is just abhorrent on the their part. If you are someone reading this that is saying things like ""oh well they tried"" ""It happens with newer games they aren't all going to be perfect"", absolutely hell no. Do not let a company that makes this much damn money get away with putting out such an incomplete pile of 'you know what' to the world.",Full_Release,not refunded,2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024

Not sure if your PC can handle the game? Do a 1 month trial pass for $1, MSFS 2024 is included. Then if you decide you like it you can buy it and cancel the monthly fee. If you don't, well it only cost you some time and $1. Did the launch have some issues, yes and that is 99% of the bad press on this game. By launch day +2 I didn't have any issues getting on the servers or having the game launch. I've had 1 game crash in the 76 hours I've played so far. That isn't bad considering the first patch isn't out yet. I highly recommend this!",Full_Release,not refunded,2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024

Ran surprisingly well in VR w/ 11th gen i5 & RTX 3060. Big improvement with default aircraft fidelity & flight models. Stunning graphics.

Although it had a rocky start, it is certainly an amazing simulator and having a bad/buggy launch just doesn't automatically make it a terrible sim like people are calling it. 10/10",Full_Release,not refunded,2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
