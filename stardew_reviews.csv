The multiplayer is fun, but time doesn't pause for cutscenes (it cant, or everyone would have to wait for everyone elses' cut scenes) so the days are much shorter in multiplayer and to really appreciate the NPCs without skipping cutscenes you should play singleplayer. Each new update brings me joy; love this game :) I play it with my friend and my brothers multiplayer and all we do is bicker about who gets to spend the communal money on what and why selling all our ore during year one is bad. There are a lot of things I still haven't discovered and I'm 7 hours away from 1000 total hours. Highly recommend.",Full_Release,not refunded,413150

There are so many tasks and quests to be done. To the point that even after playing this game for over 100 hours alone, not including the time I've played it on the switch, I still haven't beat it.

Im currently playing on a farm sort of map and I started off with my own coop. Fishing gets really addictive trying to have good hand and eye co-ordination to catch them, the mines have different themes for each new level you hit, and I love how detailed the game is and I'm not even that far in.

It's both relaxing and stressful depending on how you play. Whether it's focusing on making your farm as cute and efficient as possible while getting to know the people around town or trying to unlock all the floors in the mines while fighting different monsters before the clock hits 2am, StarDew Valley is a work of art! And that's just the tip of the ice burg. You can complete quests to progress the story or just chill and explore the valley. This game has way more to it than I initially thought. Amazing lore!

Moreover, the experience is notably enhanced when shared with a companion. It appears that potential buyers may be deterred by the misconception that the game merely entails mundane farming activities. The title lacks a crucial aspect of gameplay—namely, the capacity to inspire sustained engagement among players. Consequently, I deem it deserving of a respectable rating of 7 out of 10. Additionally, I implore developers to consider implementing guidance mechanisms, particularly during the initial year of gameplay, to alleviate the sense of disorientation experienced by newcomers. Despite having invested approximately 100 hours into the mobile version, I occasionally find myself adrift within the game's mechanics.",Full_Release,not refunded,413150

Trust me, this is the BEST cozy game you will ever play. And if it is not, there are over 10k mods that will make it the best game ever. There is no farming game that does it like SDV. No other game will scratch the itch that this game will leave you with. All you can do is install expansion mods, replay your farm or wait for the Haunter Chocolatier release (the new game being developed). ConcernedApe knows what he is doing and he has created a master piece. I don’t like pixel games and when I first got this game I couldn’t get over the pixels. A few months later I tried it again on apple arcade and fell in love. I played hours on my switch and now PC so I could add mods as well. This game made me fall in love with pixel art and has made me obsessed with farming games. Unfortunately there is nothing quite like this. What are you waiting for?
